          <p>Time is of the essence...<br>We live our life with our eyes gazing at the TIME...<br>
             Even when we feel stuck in TIME, <br>we are not aware that our age is still running...<br>
             TIME is priceless.. it is more precious than the gift of Gold...<br>
             Some still live wishing they could go back in TIME...<br>
             TIME is life because you only live once...</p>
